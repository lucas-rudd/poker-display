# poker-leaderboard 

## Development
This project works best in an IDE if you open the sub-folders in their own instance rather than the root `poker-leaderboard` folder.

Simply open up either (or both) `poker-api` or `poker-client` into their own separate IDE windows.

## Table of Contents

-   [poker-api](poker-api/README.md)
-   [poker-client](poker-client/README.md)
